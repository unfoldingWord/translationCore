# Biblical Money #

### Description:

In early Old Testament times, people weighed their metals such as silver and gold and would give a certain weight of that metal in order to buy things. Later people started to make coins that each contained a standard amount of a certain metal. The daric is one such coin.  In New Testament times, people used silver and copper coins.

The two tables below show some of the most well-known units of money found in the Old Testament (OT) and New Testament (NT). The table for Old Testament units shows what kind of metal was used and how much it weighed. The table for New Testament units shows what kind of metal was used and how much it was worth in terms of a day's wage.

| Unit in OT | Metal  | Weight  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| daric     | gold coin  | 8.4 grams      |
| shekel | various metals |  11 grams |
| talent | various metals |  33 kilograms|


| Unit in NT |  Metal |  Day's Wage  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| denarius/denarii | silver coin |  1 day |
| drachma | silver coin |  1 day |
| mite | copper coin|  1/64 day |
| shekel | silver coin |  4 days |
| talent | silver |  6,000 days |

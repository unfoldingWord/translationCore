## Translation Suggestions:
 
* The term “courtyard” could be translated as “enclosed space” or “walled-in land” or “temple grounds” or “temple enclosure.”
* Sometimes the term “temple” may need to be translated as “temple courtyards” or “temple complex” so that it is clear that the courtyards are being referred to, not the temple building.
* The expression, “courts of Yahweh” could be translated as, “place where Yahweh lives” or “place where Yahweh is worshiped.”
* The term used for a king’s court could also be used to refer to Yahweh’s court.

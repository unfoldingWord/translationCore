In general, the term “faith” refers to a belief, trust or confidence in someone or something.

* To “have faith” in someone is to believe that what he says and does is true and trustworthy.
* To “have faith in Jesus” means to believe all of God’s teachings about Jesus. It especially means that people trust in Jesus and his sacrifice to cleanse them from their sin and to rescue them from the punishment they deserve because of their sin.
* True faith or belief in Jesus will cause a person to produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors because the Holy Spirit is living in him.
* Sometimes “faith” refers generally to all the teachings about Jesus, as in the expression “the truths of the faith.”
* In contexts such as “keep the faith” or “abandon the faith,” the term “faith” refers to the state or condition of believing all the teachings about Jesus.

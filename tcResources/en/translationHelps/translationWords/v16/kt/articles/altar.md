# altar

## Definition:

An altar was a raised structure on which the Israelites burned animals and grains as offerings to God.

* During Bible times, simple altars were often made by forming a mound of packed-down dirt or by carefully placing large stones to form a stable pile.
* Some special box-shaped altars were made of wood overlaid with metals such as gold, brass, or bronze.
* Other people groups living near the Israelites also built altars to offer sacrifices to their gods.

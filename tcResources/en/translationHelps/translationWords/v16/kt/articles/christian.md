# Christian

## Definition:

Some time after Jesus went back to heaven, people made up the name “Christian” which means, “follower of Christ.”

* It was in the city of Antioch where Jesus’ followers were first called “Christians.”
* A Christian is a person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and who trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
* In our modern times, often the term “Christian” is used for someone who identifies with the Christian religion, but who is not really following Jesus. This is not the meaning of “Christian” in the Bible.
* Because the term “Christian” in the Bible always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus, a Christian is also called a “believer.”

## Translation Suggestions:

* This term could be translated as “Christ-follower” or “follower of Christ” or perhaps something like, “Christ-person.”
* Make sure that the translation of this term is translated differently than terms used for disciple or apostle.
* Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.
* Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))

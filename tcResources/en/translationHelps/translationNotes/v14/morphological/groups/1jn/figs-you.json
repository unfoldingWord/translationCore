They refer to \"the Word of life\" and \"the eternal life.\" But, since these are names for Jesus, you can use pronouns that refer to a person like \"who,\" \"whom\" or \"he.\" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])",

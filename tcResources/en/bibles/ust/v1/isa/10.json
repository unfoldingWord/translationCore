  "3": "When I punish you\\q2 by sending people from distant lands to cause you disasters,\n\\q1 to whom will you run to get help?\n\\q2 Your valuable possessions will certainly not be safe anywhere.\n\\q1",
  "4": "You will be able only to stumble along as your enemies take you away with other prisoners,\\q2 or else your corpses will lie on the ground with others who have been killed.\n\\q1 But even after that happens,\n\\q2 Yahweh will still be very angry with you.\n\\q1 He will still be ready to strike you again with his fist.\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "5": "Yahweh says, \"Terrible things will happen to Assyria.\\q2 It is true that their army is like a rod or a club with which I punish other nations\n\\q2 because I am very angry with those nations.\n\\q1",
  "6": "Sometimes I send the Assyrians to attack a godless nation,\\q2 to fight against other people who have caused me to be angry.\n\\q1 I send them to capture people and to seize and take away their possessions,\n\\q2 and to trample them like people walk on mud in the streets.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "7": "But the king of Assyria does not understand;\\q2 he does not realize that he is only like a weapon in my hand.\n\\q1 He only wants to destroy people,\n\\q2 to get rid of many nations.\n\\q1",
  "8": "He says, 'All of my army commanders will soon be kings of these nations that I conquer!\\q2",
  "9": "We destroyed the city of Kalno as we destroyed the city of Carchemish.\\q1 We destroyed the city of Hamath as we destroyed the city of Arpad;\n\\q2 we destroyed Samaria just like we destroyed Damascus.\n\n\n\\q1",

  "4": "He will not become exhausted or discouraged all during the time that he is causing things to be done justly throughout the earth.\\q1 Even people living on the islands in the oceans will confidently wait for him to teach them his laws.\"\n\n\n\\q1",
  "5": "Yahweh our God created the sky\\q2 and spread it out.\n\\q1 He also created the earth and everything on it.\n\\q2 He gives breath to all the people on the earth and causes them to live.\n\\q1 And he is the one who says to his special servant,\n\\q1",

  "25": "Therefore he was extremely angry with us,\\q2 and he caused our soldiers to be destroyed in battles.\n\\q1 It was as though he had lit a fire around us,\n\\q2 but we did not understand what he was trying to tell us.\n\\q1 His anger with us was like a fire that would burn us up,\n\\q2 but we did not pay attention."

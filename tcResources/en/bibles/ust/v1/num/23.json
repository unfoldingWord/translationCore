  "3": "Then Balaam said to Balak, \"You stand here close to your burned offerings, and I will go and ask Yahweh if he has something else to tell me. Then I will tell you what he says to me.\" Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill.",
  "4": "While he was on the top of the hill, God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, \"We have built seven altars, and I have killed and burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice to you on each altar.\"",
  "5": "Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, \"Go back and tell him what I told you.\"",
  "6": "When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab beside the offerings he had burned on the altar.",
  "7": "This is the message that Balaam told them,\\q1 \"Balak summoned me to come here from Aram;\n\\q2 the king of Moab brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Aram.\n\\q1 He said, 'Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me!\n\\q2 Come and say that bad things will happen to these Israelite people!'\n\\q1",
  "8": "But how can I curse people whom God has not cursed?\\q2 How can I fight against people against whom Yahweh does not fight?\n\\q1",

  "10": "Who can count the descendants of Jacob, as numerous as particles of dust!\\q2 Who can count even a fourth of the number of the Israelite people?\n\\q1 I wish that I will die like righteous people die.\n\\q2 I hope that I will die peacefully like they will die.\"",
  "11": "Then Balak said, \"What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead you have blessed them!\"",
  "12": "But Balaam replied, \"I can say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot say anything else.\"",
  "13": "Then King Balak told Balaam, \"Come with me to another place. There you will see only part of the Israelite people, and you will be able to curse those people for me.\"",
  "14": "So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Mount Pisgah. There, again he built seven altars and offered a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.",
  "15": "Then Balaam said to the king, \"Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh.\"",

  "23": "When people curse the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed,\\q2 when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power.\n\\q1 So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob,\n\\q2 'God has done wonderful things for the Israelites!'\n\\q1",
  "24": "They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack other animals.\\q2 They stand firm like lions.\n\\q1 The lions refuse to rest until they have killed and eaten their prey\n\\q2 and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.\"",

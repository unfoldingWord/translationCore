  "18": "See what the land is like. See if the people who live there are strong or weak. See if there are many people or only a few people.",

  "32": "So those men gave to the Israelite people a bad report about the land that they had explored. They said, \"The land that we explored destroys the life those who try to attack it. And all the people living there are very tall.",
  "33": "We also saw giants there. They are the descendants of Anak (who come from the Nephilim, those giant people). When we saw these giants we felt as small as grasshoppers and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too.\""

  "7": "Then the soldiers of Babylonia broke through a section of the city wall, and all the Israelite soldiers fled. But because the city was surrounded by soldiers from Babylonia, Zedekiah and the Israelite soldiers waited until it became dark. Then they left the city through the gate between the two walls behind the king's garden. Then they ran toward the plain along the Jordan.",
  "8": "But the soldiers of Babylonia pursued King Zedekiah, and they caught up with him on the plains near Jericho. He was alone because all his men had all deserted him and had scattered.",

  "19": "Nebuzaradan also told his soldiers to take away the small bowls, the dishes for burning incense, the basins, pots, lampstands, bowls for incense, and the bowls used for pouring out the wine offerings. They took all the other items that were made of pure gold or silver.",
  "20": "The bronze from the two pillars, the large water tank called \"The Sea\" and the twelve statues of oxen that were beneath it, and the water carts, was more than they could weigh. Those things had been made for the temple during the time that Solomon was the king.",
  "21": "Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around. They were hollow, and each had sides that were 3 inches thick.",
  "22": "The bronze head on the top of each pillar was seven and one-half feet high and was decorated all around with a bronze network of figures that represented pomegranates.",

  "25": "He found some other people who were hiding in the city. So from them he took a commander of the army of Judah, seven of the king's advisors, the army commander's chief secretary who was in charge of recruiting soldiers for the army, and sixty other soldiers.",
  "26": "Nebuzaradan took them all to the king of Babylon, who was still at Riblah.",
  "27": "There at Riblah in the Hamath region, the king of Babylon commanded that they all be executed. Many of the people of Judah were forced to leave their own land.",

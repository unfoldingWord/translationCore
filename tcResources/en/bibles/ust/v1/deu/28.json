  "54": "54-55 When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and sensitive men among you will want food very desperately, with the result that they will kill their own children and eat their flesh, because they will not have anything else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their brothers or wives whom they love very much or with any of their other children who are still alive.",
  "55": "56-57 Even the most gentle and kind women among you, who are very rich with the result that they have never been forced to walk anywhere, will do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a child, they will secretly kill the baby and eat its flesh and also eat the afterbirth. And they will not share any of it with their husbands whom they love very much or with any of their other children.",
  "56": "If you do not faithfully obey all of the laws that I am writing, and if you do not have the utmost respect for Yahweh our glorious God,",
  "57": "he will punish you by sending on you and on your descendants great afflictions and plagues which will last for many years.",
  "58": "He will bring on you the plagues that he sent on the people of Egypt, and you will never be healed.",
  "59": "He will also send on you many other sicknesses and diseases that I have not talked about in these laws, until you all will die.",
  "60": "You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your God.",
  "61": "Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become very numerous, but now he will be happy to ruin you and get rid of you. Those of you who do not die from these plagues will be snatched away from the land that you will soon be entering to possess.",
  "62": "Yahweh will scatter you among many people groups, all over the earth, and in those places you will worship other gods that are made of wood or stone, gods which you and your ancestors have never known.",
  "63": "In those areas you will not have any peace. You will feel hopeless and be discouraged.",
  "64": "You will always be afraid that your enemies will kill you. You will be very fearful, all day and all night.",
  "65": "Because you will be very fearful and because you will very distressed because of the terrible things that you see, each morning you will say 'I wish it were evening already!' and each evening you will say 'I wish it were morning already!'",
  "66": "Yahweh will send some of you back to Egypt in ships, even though he promised that you would never be forced to go there again. There in Egypt you will try to sell yourselves to become slaves of your enemies in order to have food to eat, but no one will buy you.\""

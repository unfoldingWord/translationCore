  "6": "Then Yahweh called again, \"Samuel!\" So Samuel got up again and went to Eli and said, \"I am here, because you called me!\" But Eli said, \"No, my son, I did not call you. Go back and lie down.\"",

  "8": "After Samuel lay down again, Yahweh called him a third time. So again Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, \"I am here, because you called me!\" Then Eli realized that it was Yahweh who was calling the boy.",
  "9": "So he said to Samuel, \"Go and lie down again. If someone calls you again, say 'Speak to me, Yahweh, because I am listening!'\" So Samuel went and lay down again.",
  "10": "Then Yahweh came and stood and called as he had done the other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" Then Samuel said, \"Speak to me, because I am listening!\"",
  "11": "Then Yahweh said to Samuel, \"Listen carefully. I am about to do something here in Israel that will shock everyone who hears about it.",

  "16": "But Eli called him and said, \"Samuel, my son!\" Samuel answered, \"I am here!\"",
  "17": "Eli asked him, \"What was it that Yahweh told you? Do not conceal it! I want God to punish you severely if you do not tell me everything that he said to you.\"",
  "18": "So Samuel told him everything. He did not refuse to tell him anything. Then Eli said, \"He is Yahweh. I am willing for him to do what he thinks is best.\"",
  "19": "As Samuel grew up, Yahweh helped him; he made everything that Samuel predicted to come true.",

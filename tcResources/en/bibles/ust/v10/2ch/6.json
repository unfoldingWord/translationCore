  "6": "But now I have chosen Jerusalem to be the place for people to worship me, and I have chosen you, David, to rule my Israelite people.'\"\n\ni",
  "7": "Then Solomon said further, \"My father David wanted to build a temple for Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.",
  "8": "But Yahweh said to him, 'It is good that you wanted to build a house for me.",
  "9": "However, you are not the one who I want to build the temple, It is one of your own sons who will build it.'\n\ni",
  "10": "And Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to rule after my father, and I am ruling the people, as Yahweh promised, and I have arranged for this temple to be built for us to worship Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.",
  "11": "I have put the sacred chest in the temple, in which are the stone tablets showing the covenant that Yahweh made with us Israelite people.\"",
  "12": "Then Solomon stood in front of the altar that was in front of the people of Israel who had gathered there. He spread out his hands as he began to pray.",
  "13": "Now His workers had built a bronze platform there for him to stand on, which was two and one-third meters square and one and one-half meters high. They had put it in the outer courtyard. Solomon mounted that platform and then knelt down in front of all the people of Israel who had gathered there, and he spread out his arms toward heaven.",
  "14": "Then he prayed, \"Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth. You solemnly promised in your covenant that you would faithfully love us, and that is what you have done for us who earnestly do what you want us to do.\ni",
  "15": "You have done the things that you promised my father David, who served you very well, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do those things for him, and today we see that by your power you have caused it all to happen.\n\ni",
  "16": "So now, Yahweh, the God we Israelites worship Israel, as you promised your servant David, my father, please make sure that he will always have a descendant who will be king of Israel. For you promise you would do this if his descendants were faithful to you.",
  "17": "So now, God of us Israelite people, cause what you promised David, who served you well, to become true.\n\ni",
  "18": "But, my God, will you really live on earth among us? This temple I have built cannot contain you; not even the universe and heaven itself can contain you.",

  "23": "then please listen from heaven and decide who is telling the truth. Then punish the person who is guilty as he deserves to be punished, and do good to the other person as a reward for his innocence.\n\ni",
  "24": "And suppose that your Israelite people are defeated by their enemies because they sinned against you, and forced to go to some distant country. Suppose further that they turn away from their sinful behavior and face in the direction of this temple and acknowledge that you have justly punished them; and suppose that they beg you to forgive them.",

  "26": "When you do not allow any rain to fall because the people have sinned against you—then, if they stop acting sinfully and humbly pray to you, you who are present in this place,",
  "27": "then listen from heaven and forgive the sins of your people. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives. Then send rain on the land that you gave to your people forever.\n\ni",
  "28": "And when the people of this land experience famines, or if there is a plague or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies surround any of their cities in order to attack them—if any of these disaster happens to them—",
  "29": "and then if your Israelite people earnestly plead, or if even just one person does so—if they stretch out their hands toward this temple and pray to you because they know the weakness and sorrow in their own hearts—",
  "30": "then listen from your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know what each person is thinking, so reward each person according to everything that he does.",
  "31": "Do this in order that they might honor you and conduct their lives as you want them to, all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.\n\ni",
  "32": "There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and powerful. If they turn toward this temple and pray,",
  "33": "then from your home in heaven please listen to their prayer and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will honor and obey you, as your people of Israel do. And do this so that they will know that you are present in this temple that I have built.\n\ni",
  "34": "When you send your people to go and attack their enemies, if they pray to you, no matter where they are, and if they turn toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you,",
  "35": "then will you please listen from heaven to their prayers. Listen to what they plead for you to do, and give them help.\n\ni",
  "36": "It is true that everyone sins. So when your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you might allow their enemies to capture them and take them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.",
  "37": "When that happens, while they are in those distant countries, if they say 'We have sinned; we have done things that are wrong and have done things that are very wicked,'",
  "38": "suppose that they repent very sincerely and pray facing this land that you gave their ancestors, and facing this city that you chose, and facing this temple that I have built for you to be present in.",

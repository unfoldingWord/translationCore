  "5": "But you Israelite people have been very unfaithful to him;\\q because of your sins, you no longer deserve to be his children.\n\\q You are extremely wicked and deceitful.\n\\q1",
  "6": "You foolish and senseless people,\\q is this the way that you should repay Yahweh for all that he has done for you?\n\\q He is your father; he created you;\n\\q he caused you to become a nation.\n\n\n\\q",

  "15": "The Israelite people became rich and prosperous,\\q but then they rebelled against God;\n\\q they abandoned him, the one who created them,\n\\q the one who powerfully saves them.\n\\q",

  "20": "He said, 'They are very wicked people,\\q very unfaithful;\n\\q so I will no longer help them,\n\\q and then I will watch and see what happens to them.\n\n\n\\q",

  "29": "If you were wise, you would understand why you would be punished;\\q you would have realized what was going to happen to you.\n\n\n\\q",
  "30": "You would have realized why a thousand of your soldiers would be defeated by only one of the enemy soldiers,\\q and why two of your enemies would chase away ten thousand Israelite soldiers.\n\\q You would realize that this would happen only if God, the one who always defended you, had put you in the hands of your enemies,\n\\q that Yahweh had abandoned you.\n\\q",
  "31": "Your enemies know that their gods are not powerful like Yahweh, our God,\\q so their gods could not have defeated us Israelites.\n\n\n\\q",
  "32": "Your enemies are like grapevines planted near the ruins of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah;\\q the grapes from those vines are bitter and poisonous.\n\\q",
  "33": "The wine from those grapes is like the poison of snakes.\\q",
  "34": "Yahweh says, 'I know what I have planned to do to the Israelite people and to their enemies,\\q and I have locked up those plans as someone would lock up his valuable possessions.\n\n\n\\q",
  "35": "I am the one who will get revenge and pay those enemies back for what they have done to my people,\\q at the right time for them to be punished;\n\\q they will soon experience disasters,\n\\q and I will punish them quickly.'\n\n\n\\q",
  "36": "But Yahweh will say that you who are truly his people are innocent,\\q and he will act mercifully toward you who serve him,\n\\q when he sees that you are helpless,\n\\q and that there are very few of you, slaves or free people, who are still alive.\n\n\n\\q",

  "39": "But now you will realize that I, only I, am God;\\q there is no other god who is a real god.\n\\q I am the one who can kill people and who can cause people to live;\n\\q I can wound people, and I can heal people,\n\\q and there is no one who can prevent me from doing those things.\n\\q",

  "43": "You people of all nations, you should praise Yahweh's people,\\q because Yahweh gets revenge on those who kill the people who serve him,\n\\q and he cleanses his people's land\n\\q which has become defiled because of their sins.\"",
  "44": "Joshua and Moses sang that song while the Israelite people were listening.",

  "51": "You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israelite people, when you all were at the springs of Meribah near Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israelite people in the way that I deserve because I am God.",
  "52": "When you are on that mountain where I told you to go, you will see in the distance in front of you the land that I am about to give to the Israelite people, but you will not enter it.\""

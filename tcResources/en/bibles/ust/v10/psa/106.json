  "7": "When our ancestors were in Egypt,\\q2 they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did;\n\\q2 they forgot about the many times that he showed that he faithfully loved them.\n\\q1 Instead, when they were at the Sea of Reeds,\n\\q2 they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "8": "But he rescued them for the sake of his own reputation\\q2 so that he could show that he is very powerful.\n\\q1",

  "24": "Later, our ancestors refused to enter the beautiful land of Canaan\\q2 because they did not believe that God would do as he promised and would enable them to take the land from the people who were living there.\n\\q1",
  "25": "They stayed in their tents and grumbled\\q2 and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do.\n\n\n\\q1",

  "28": "Later the Israelite people started to worship the idol of Baal at Mount Peor,\\q1 and they ate meat that had been sacrificed to Baal and those other lifeless gods.\n\\q1",
  "29": "Yahweh became very angry because of what they had done,\\q2 so again he sent a terrible disease to attack them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "30": "But Phinehas stood up and punished the ones who had sinned greatly,\\q2 and as a result the plague ended.\n\\q1",
  "31": "People have remembered that righteous deed that Phinehas did,\\q2 and in future years people will remember it.\n\n\n\n\\q1",

  "33": "They caused Moses to become very angry,\\q2 and he said things that were foolish.\n\\q1",
  "34": "Our ancestors did not destroy the other people groups\\q2 as he told them to do.\n\\q1",
  "35": "Instead, the men took women from those people groups,\\q2 and they started to do the evil things that those people did.\n\\q1",
  "36": "Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people,\\q2 which resulted in their being destroyed.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "37": "Some of the Israelites sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons that those idols represented.\\q1",
  "38": "They killed children who had done nothing wrong,\\q1 and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan.\n\\q2 As a result, the land of Canaan was polluted by those murders.\n\\q1",
  "39": "So by their deeds they made it impossible for God to accept them;\\q2 because they did not faithfully worship only God,\n\\q2 they became like women who sleep with other men instead of sleeping only with their husbands.\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "40": "So Yahweh became very angry with his people;\\q2 he was completely disgusted with them.\n\\q1",
  "41": "As a result, he allowed people groups who did not believe in him to conquer them,\\q2 so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "42": "Their enemies oppressed them\\q2 and completely controlled them.\n\\q1",
  "43": "Many times Yahweh rescued his people,\\q2 but they continued to rebel against him,\n\\q2 and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed.\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "44": "However, Yahweh always heard them when they cried out to him,\\q2 and he listened to them when they were distressed.\n\\q1",
  "45": "For their sake, he thought about the covenant that he had made to bless them;\\q2 because he never stopped loving them very much,\n\\q2 he changed his mind about punishing them more.\n\\q1",

  "47": "Yahweh our God, rescue us\\q1 and bring us back to Israel from among those people groups\n\\q2 so that we may thank you\n\\q2 and joyfully praise you.\n\\q1",
  "48": "Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites worship,\\q1 praise him now and forever!\n\\q1 All the people should agree!\n\\q2 Praise Yahweh!"

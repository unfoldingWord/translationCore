  "3": "But if that happens during the daytime, the one who killed the thief is guilty of murdering him.\nA thief must pay for what he stole. If he has no animal with which to pay for the one that he stole, he must be sold to become someone else's slave, and the money from his sale must be used to pay for what he stole.",

  "11": "Then the person who was taking care of the animal must swear, knowing that God is listening, that he did not steal the animal. If he did not steal it, the owner of the animal must accept that the other person is telling the truth, and the other person will not have to pay anything back to the owner.",

  "27": "because he needs it to keep him warm during the night. That is the only covering that poor people have when they sleep at night. If you do not act mercifully toward him by giving back his cloak, when he cries out to me asking for my help, I will help him because I always act mercifully.",

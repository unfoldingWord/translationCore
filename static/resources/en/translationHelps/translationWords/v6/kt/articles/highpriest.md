# high priest #

## Definition: ##

The term "high priest" refers to a special priest who was appointed to serve for one year as the leader of all the other Israelite priests. 

* The high priest had special responsibilities. He was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy part of the temple to offer a special sacrifice once a year.
* The Israelites had many priests, but only one high priest at a time.
* When Jesus was being arrested, Caiaphas was the official high priest. Caiphas' father-in-law Annas is also mentioned sometimes because he was a former high priest who probably still had power and authority over the people.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* "High priest" could be translated as "supreme priest" or "highest ranking priest."
* Make sure this term is translated differently from the term "chief priest."

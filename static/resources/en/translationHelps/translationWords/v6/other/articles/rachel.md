Rachel was one of Jacob's wives. She and her sister Leah were the daughters of Laban, Jacob's uncle.

* Rachel was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, whose descendants became two of the tribes of Israel.
* For many years, Rachel was not able to have any children. Then God enabled her to give birth to Joseph.
* Years later, as she gave birth to Benjamin, Rachel died, and Jacob buried her near Bethlehem.

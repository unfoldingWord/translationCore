# Judas Iscariot #

## Facts: ##

Judas Iscariot was one of Jesus' apostles. He was the one who betrayed Jesus to the Jewish leaders.

* The name "Iscariot" may mean "from Kerioth," perhaps indicating that Judas grew up in that city.
* Judas Iscariot managed the apostles' money and regularly stole some of it to use for himself.
* Judas betrayed Jesus by telling the religious leaders where Jesus was so they could arrest him.
* After the religious leaders condemned Jesus to die, Judas regretted that he had betrayed Jesus, so he gave the betrayal money back to the Jewish leaders and then killed himself.
* Another apostle was also named Judas, as was one of Jesus' brothers. Jesus' brother was also known as "Jude."

* Sometimes the term "torment" refers to physical pain and suffering. For example, the book of Revelation describes physical torment that worshipers of the "beast" will suffer in the end times.
* Suffering may also take the form of spiritual and emotional pain, as experienced by Job.
* The apostle John wrote in the book of Revelation that people who do not believe in Jesus as their Savior will experience eternal torment in the lake of fire.

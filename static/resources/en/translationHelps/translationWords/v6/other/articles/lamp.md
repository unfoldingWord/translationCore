# lamp #

## Definition: ##

The term "lamp" generally refers to something that produces light. The lamps used in Bible times were usually oil lamps.

The type of lamp that was used in Bible times is a small container with a fuel source, usually oil, that gives light when it burns.

* An ordinary oil lamp usually consisted of a common piece of pottery filled with olive oil, with a wick placed in the oil to burn.
* For some lamps, the pot or jar was oval, with one end pinched close together to hold the wick.
* An oil lamp could be carried or placed on a stand so that its light could fill a room or house.
* In scripture, lamps are used in several figurative ways as symbols of light and life.

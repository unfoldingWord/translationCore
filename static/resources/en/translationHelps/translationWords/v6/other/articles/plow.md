## Definition: ##

A "plow" is a farm tool that is used for breaking up soil to prepare a field for planting.

* Plows have sharp, pointed prongs that dig into the soil. They usually have handles that the farmer uses to guide the plow.
* In Bible times, plows were usually pulled by a pair of oxen or other work animals.
* Most plows were made of hard wood, except for the sharp points which were made of a metal, such as bronze or iron.

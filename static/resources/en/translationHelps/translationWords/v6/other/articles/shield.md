# shield #

## Definition: ##

A shield was an object held by a soldier in battle to protect himself from being injured by the enemy's weapons. "To shield" someone means to protect that person from harm.

* Shields were often circular or oval, were made of materials such as leather, wood, or metal, andt were sturdy and thick enough to keep a sword or arrow from piercing them. 
* Using this term as a metaphor, the Bible refers to God as a protective shield for his people. (See: Metaphor)
* Paul talked about the "shield of faith," which is a figurative way of saying that having faith in Jesus and living out that faith in obedience to God will protect believers from the spiritual attacks of Satan.

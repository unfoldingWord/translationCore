# sign, signs, proof, reminder #

## Definition: ##

A sign is an object, event, or action that communicates a special meaning.

* “Reminders” are signs that “remind” people by helping them remember something, often something that was promised:
    * The rainbows God creates in the sky are signs to remind people that he has promised he will never again destroy all life with a worldwide flood.
    * God commanded the Israelites to circumcise their sons as a sign of his covenant with them.
* Signs can reveal or point to something:
    * An angel gave shepherds a sign that would help them know which baby in Bethlehem was the newborn Messiah.\
    * Judas kissed Jesus as a sign to the religious leaders that Jesus was the one they should arrest.
* Signs can prove that something is true:
    * The miracles performed by the prophets and apostles were signs that proved they were speaking God's message.
    * The miracles that Jesus performed were signs that proved he was truly the Messiah.

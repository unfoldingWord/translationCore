  "15": "And, we suggest that you order your officials to search among the records kept by your ancestors. If you do that, you will find out that the people in this city have always rebelled against thegovernment. You will also find out that from long ago these people caused trouble for kings and for rulers of provinces. They have always revolted against those who ruled them. That is the\nreason that this city was destroyed by the Babylonian army.",

  "22": "Do this immediately, because I do not want those people to do anything to harm the things about which I am concerned.\"",
  "23": "Messengers took that letter to Rehum and Shimshai and their colleagues and read it to them. Then Rehum and the others went quickly to Jerusalem, and they forced the Jews to stoprebuilding the city wall.",

  "9": "Then the angel of Yahweh placed a stone in front of Joshua and said to him and to the other men with him: \"Look at the stone that I have put in front of Joshua. There are seven sides on the stone. I will engrave a message on that stone, and in one day I will remove the guilt of all the people of this country.",
  "10": "At that time, each of you will invite his friends to come and sit under his grapevine and under his fig tree. That is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, declares.\""

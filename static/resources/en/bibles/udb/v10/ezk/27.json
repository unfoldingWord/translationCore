  "25": "Cargo ships from Tarshish carried all those things that you sold;\\q2 the warehouses on your island were full of all those things and brought you great honor.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "26": "The men who row your ships took the ships full of cargo out onto the large seas.\\q2 But now the strong east wind has wrecked those ships.\n\\q1",
  "27": "Everything in the ships has been lost—\\q2 all the valuable cargo and many of the sailors and ship pilots,\n\\q1 the ship workers and merchants and soldiers.\n\\q1 On the day that the ships were wrecked,\n\\q2 all their crews sank to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\\q1",

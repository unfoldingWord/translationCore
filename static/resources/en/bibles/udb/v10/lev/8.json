  "23": "He picked up all the fat of the ram, its fat tail, the fat that covered the inner parts, including the fat that covered the liver and kidneys, and the right thigh of the ram.",
  "24": "26-27 Then from the basket containing the bread that was made without yeast, the bread which had been dedicated to Yahweh, he picked up one loaf of bread made without olive oil, and one loaf that was made by mixing the flour with olive oil, and one wafer. He put those on top of the portions of fat, and put them into the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then they lifted them up in the presence of Yahweh to show that it was an offering that belonged to him.",

  "30": "The time for you to be set apart as priests will be seven days, so do not leave the entrance of the sacred tent for seven days.",
  "31": "What we have done today is what Yahweh commanded to cause you to be forgiven for your sins.",
  "32": "You must stay at the entrance to the sacred tent for seven days and seven nights and do what Yahweh requires, in order that you will not die because of disobeying him. I am telling you that because that is what Yahweh has commanded me to tell you.\"",
  "33": "So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh told Moses to tell them."

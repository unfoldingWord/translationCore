  "5": "From the time Potiphar appointed Joseph to take care of everything in his household and all that he owned, Yahweh blessed the people who lived in Potiphar's house because of Joseph. He also caused Potiphar's crops to grow well.",
  "6": "Potiphar allowed Joseph to take care of everything that he owned. Potiphar needed to decide only about the food he ate. He did not worry about anything else in his house. Now Joseph was well built and handsome.",

  "8": "But he refused, saying to his master's wife, \"Listen! My master is not concerned about anything in this house. He has appointed me to take care of everything that he owns.",
  "9": "No one in this household has more authority than I do. The only thing that he has not allowed me to have is you, because you are his wife! So how could I do this wicked thing that you are asking me to do? I would be sinning against God if I did that!\"",

  "16": "She kept the clothing beside her until her husband, Joseph's master, came home.",
  "17": "Then she told him this story: \"That Hebrew slave whom you brought here came into where I was and tried to force me to sleep with him!",
  "18": "As soon as I screamed loudly, he ran outside, leaving his clothing beside me!\"",
  "19": "When Joseph's master heard this story that his wife told him, and when she said, \"This is how your slave treated me,\" he was very angry.",
  "20": "Joseph's master took Joseph and put him in prison, in the place where all the king's prisoners were put, and Joseph stayed there.",
  "21": "But Yahweh was kind to Joseph and helped him because of his covenant with his ancestors; he caused the prison warden to be pleased with him.",
  "22": "So the prison warden put Joseph in charge of all those who were in the prison, and in charge of all the work that was done there.",
  "23": "The warden was not concerned with anything that Joseph was taking care of, because Yahweh helped Joseph to do all his work well."

  "3": "I called out to Yahweh, who deserves for me to praise him, and he rescued me from my enemies.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "4": "All around me were dangerous situations in which I might die; it was as though there were huge waves that almost crashed on me and killed me.\\q1",
  "5": "It was as though the place where dead people are had ropes that were wrapped around me, or it was as though there was a trap that would seize and kill me.\n\n\\q1",
  "6": "But when I was very distressed, I called out to Yahweh, and far off in his temple he heard me.\\q1 He listened to me when I cried out for help.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "7": "Then Yahweh became angry, and the earth quaked, and the mountains shook to their very foundations!\\q1",
  "8": "He was so angry that it was as though smoke poured out from his nostrils, as though burning coals came out of his mouth!\n\n\\q1",

  "14": "He shot his arrows at them and caused them to scatter; his flashes of lightning caused them to become very confused.\n\n\\q1",
  "15": "The bottom of the ocean became visible, and the water uncovered the foundations of the earth when Yahweh rebuked his enemies\\q with the breath that came in his anger!\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "16": "It was as though he reached down from heaven and grabbed me and pulled me up out of the deep ocean.\\q1",
  "17": "He rescued me from my strong enemies who hated me; they were very strong, and I could not defeat them by myself.\n\n\\q1",
  "18": "When I was distressed, they attacked me, but Yahweh defended me.\\q1",
  "19": "He made me completely safe; he rescued me because he was pleased with me.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "20": "Yahweh has rewarded me because I do what is right; he has blessed me because I am innocent.\\q1",
  "21": "I have obeyed Yahweh's laws; I have not abandoned him.\n\n\\q1",
  "22": "I have followed his decrees; I have not stopped obeying them.\\q1",
  "23": "He knows that I have not done what is wrong and that I have kept myself from sinning.\\q1",
  "24": "So he rewards me because I do what is right; he knows that I have not committed sins.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "25": "Yahweh, you are faithful to those who faithfully do your covenant; you always do what is good to those who do not do evil.\\q1",
  "26": "You are kind to those who are honest toward others, but you act wisely toward those who act dishonestly.\n\n\\q1",
  "27": "You save those who are humble, but you humiliate those who are proud.\\q1",
  "28": "You keep me alive, and you will continue to do so.\\q1",
  "29": "You enable me to be strong, so that I can attack and defeat a line of enemy soldiers; with your help I can scale the walls that surround my enemies' cities.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "30": "Everything that Yahweh my God does is perfect. We can depend on him to do what he promises.\\q He is like a shield to protect all those who go to him to be safe.\n\\q1",

  "38": "When I strike them, they are not able to get up again; they lie on the ground, defeated.\\q1",
  "39": "You have enabled me to be strong in order that I can fight battles and defeat my enemies.\n\n\\q1",
  "40": "You delivered my enemies to me, for me to strike them on their necks. I have gotten rid of all those who hated me.\\q1",
  "41": "They shouted for someone to help them, but no one saved them. They shouted out to Yahweh, but he did not help them.\\q1",
  "42": "I crushed them to powder, and they became like the dust that the wind blows away; I threw them out like people throw dirt out into the streets.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "43": "You enabled me to defeat those who fought against me and appointed me to be the ruler of many nations; people whom I did not know about previously are now slaves in my kingdom.\\q1",
  "44": "When foreigners hear about me, they cringe and they obey me.\\q1",
  "45": "They are no longer courageous, and from their holes where they were hiding they come to me trembling.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "46": "Yahweh is alive! Praise the one who is like a huge rock on top of which I am safe! Exalt the God who saves me!\\q1",

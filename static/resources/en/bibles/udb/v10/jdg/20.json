  "8": "All the people stood up, and unitedly said, \"None of us will go home! Not one of us will return to his house!",

  "31": "When the men of the tribe of Benjamin came out of the city to fight against them, the Israelite men retreated away from the city, and the men of the tribe of Benjamin pursued them. The men of the tribe of Benjamin killed many Israelites, like they had done before. They killed about thirty Israelites, who died in the fields and on the roads—one of the roads went to Bethel and another road went to Gibeah.",
  "32": "The men of the tribe of Benjamin said, \"We are defeating them like we did before!\" But then Israelite men did what they had planned.

  "33": "The main group of Israelite men left their positions and retreated, and then they stood in their battle positions again at a place named Baal Tamar. Then the soldiers of Israel who had been hiding in secret places ran out from their places in Maareh Gibeah.",
  "34": "Then the other ten thousand Israelites came out from the places where they had been hiding, west of Gibeah, and attacked the city. They were men who had come from all parts of Israel. There was a very big battle. But the men of the tribe of Benjamin did not know that they were about to have a disastrous defeat.",
  "35": "Yahweh enabled the Israelite men to defeat the men of the tribe of Benjamin. They killed 25,100 of them, all of them were fighting men.",
  "36": "So the soldiers of Benjamin saw they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, because they were counting on the men they had placed in hidden positions outside Gibeah to go out and shift the battle in their favor.",
  "37": "Then the men who were hiding got up and hurried and they rushed into Gibeah, and with their swords they killed everyone who lived in the city.",
  "38": "Now the arranged signal between the soldiers of Israel and the men hiding in secret would be that a great cloud of smoke would rise up out of the city.",
  "39": "By that time, Israelite men had turned away from attacking, so the men of the tribe of Benjamin said, \"We are winning the battle, as we did before!\"",
  "40": "But then smoke from the burning buildings began to rise up from the city. The men of the tribe of Benjamin turned around and saw that the whole city was burning.",
  "41": "Then the main group of Israelite men also saw the smoke, and they knew that the smoke signaled that they should turn around and begin to attack. The men of the tribe of Benjamin were very afraid, because they realized that they were about to have a disastrous defeat.",

  "43": "They surrounded some of the men of the tribe of Benjamin, and pursued the others to the area east of Gibeah.",
  "44": "They killed eighteen thousand strong soldiers of the tribe of Benjamin.",
  "45": "Then the rest of the men of the tribe of Benjamin realized that they had been defeated.

  "3": "The men of Judah went to their fellow Israelites, the men from the tribe of Simeon, and said to them, \"Come and help us to fight the Canaanites in order that we can take from them the land that Yahweh allotted to us.

  "25": "So the man showed them a way to enter the city. The men of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh entered the city and killed all the people with their swords, but they did not kill the man who showed them how to get into the city, and they did not kill his family.",
  "26": "That man went to the area where the descendants of Heth lived, and he built a city. He named the city Luz, and that is still the name of that city.",
  "27": "There were Canaanites who lived in Beth Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo cities and in the surrounding villages. The men of the tribe of Manasseh did not force them to leave those towns, because the Canaanites were determined to stay there.",

  "33": "The men of the tribe of Naphtali did not compel the people who lived in the cities of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath to leave, so they continued to live with the Canaanites in those cities, but the Canaanites were forced to work as the slaves of Naphtali.",

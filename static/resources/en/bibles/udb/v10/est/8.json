  "6": "How can I bear to see disaster come on my people? How can I endure seeing the destruction of all my relatives?\"",
  "7": "King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, \"Because Haman tried to get rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther everything that belonged to Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows.",
  "8": "So now I am also permitting you to write another letter with a new decree in it, so that you may save your people. You may put my name on the letters and use my ring to seal them. This is because no letter that has my name on it and that is sealed with my ring can ever be revoked.\"",
  "9": "Then the king's scribes were called at that time (in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month).

It was written to the provincial governors, the governors and officials of the provinces that are from India all the way to Ethiopia, in total, 127 provinces. The letter was written to every province in the way that every language was written. It was also written to the Jews in their writing and language.",

  "15": "Mordecai left the palace, wearing the blue and white robe and a large gold crown that the king gave him. He also put on a robe of fine purple cloth. When the people in Susa heard the new law, they all shouted and cheered.",
  "16": "The Jews in Susa were now happy, instead of being afraid. They rejoiced instead of fearing, and other people honored them.",
  "17": "When the new decree arrived in every city and province, the Jews there celebrated and prepared feasts and were very joyful. And many people throughout the empire became Jews, because they had become very afraid of the Jews."

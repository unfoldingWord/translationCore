  "2": "The servant read about Bigthana and Teresh, the two officials who had guarded the entrance to the king's rooms. He read the account of when Mordecai had found out that they planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus and that he had told the king about it.",

  "4": "The king said, \"Is there anyone in the courtyard?\" At that moment, Haman had entered the outer courtyard of the palace. He wanted to talk to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had just set up.",
  "5": "His servants replied, \"Haman is in the courtyard.\" The king said, \"Bring him in.\"",

  "13": "Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends about everything that had happened to him.

You are sure to be defeated by him.\"",

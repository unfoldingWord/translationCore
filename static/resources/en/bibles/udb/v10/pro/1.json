  "22": "She cries, \"How long will you who have not been taught, will you love being enticed to do what will harm you?\\q2 How long will you who think you know more than the wise, have so much joy in the little you know?\n\\q2 How long will you fools refuse to learn?\n\n\\q1",
  "23": "If you pay attention to me when I correct you,\\q2 I will tell you all I am thinking.\n\\q2 I will help you understand what I am saying to you.\n\\q1",

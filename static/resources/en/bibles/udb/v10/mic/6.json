  "4": "I did great things for your ancestors;\\q2 I brought them out of Egypt;\n\\q2 I rescued them from that land where they were slaves.\n\\q1 I sent Moses to lead them,\n\\q2 and his older brother Aaron and his older sister Miriam.\n\\q1",
  "5": "My people, think about when Balak, the king of Moab, requested Beor's son Balaam to curse your ancestors,\\q2 and think about what Balaam replied.\n\\q1 Think about how your ancestors crossed the Jordan River miraculously while they were traveling from Acacia to Gilgal.\n\\q2 Think about those things in order that you may know that I, Yahweh, do what is right.\"\n\n\n\\q1",

  "7": "Would Yahweh be pleased if we offered to him a thousand rams\\q2 and ten thousand streams of olive oil?\n\\q1 Should we offer our firstborn children to be sacrifices\n\\q2 to pay for the sins that we have committed?\"\n\\q1",
  "8": "No, because he has shown each of us what is good to do;\\q2 he has shown us what he requires each of us to do:\n\\q1 he wants us to do what is just and to love to act mercifully toward others,\n\\q2 and he wants us to live humbly while we fellowship with him, our God.\n\n\n\n\\q1",

  "4": "Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts.",
  "5": "For we never used words of flattery, as you know, nor as an excuse to cover up greed— God is our witness.",
  "6": "Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ.",
  "7": "Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.\\f + \\ft Some other versions read, \\fqa Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own children. \\fqa* \\f*",

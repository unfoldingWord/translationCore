{"1":"Unless Yahweh builds the house,\\q they work uselessly, those who build it.\n\\q Unless Yahweh guards the city,\n\\q the watchman stands guard uselessly.\n\\q","2":"It is useless for you to rise up early,\\q to come home late,\n\\q or to eat the bread of hard work,\n\\q for Yahweh provides for his beloved as they sleep.\n\n\n\\q","3":"See, children are a heritage from Yahweh,\\q and the fruit of the womb is a reward from him.\n\\q","4":"Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,\\q so are the children of one's youth.\n\\q","5":"How blessed is the man that has his quiver full of them.\\q He will not be put to shame\n\\q when he confronts his enemies in the gate."}

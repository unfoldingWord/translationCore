{"1":"To you I lift up my eyes,\\q you who are enthroned in the heavens.\n\\q","2":"See, as the eyes of servants look to their master's hand,\\q as the eyes of a maid look to her mistress's hand,\n\\q so our eyes look to Yahweh our God\n\\q until he has mercy on us.\n\n\n\\q","3":"Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,\\q for we are filled with humiliation.\n\\q","4":"We are more than full\\q of the scoffing of the insolent\n\\q and with the contempt of the proud."}

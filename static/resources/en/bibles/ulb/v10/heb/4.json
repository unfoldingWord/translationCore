{"1":"Therefore, let us be very careful so that none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest.","2":"For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed.\\f + \\ft Other versions read, \\fqa But that message did not benefit those who heard it without joining faith to it. \\fqa* \\f*","3":"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as he said,\\q \"As I swore in my wrath,\n\\q They will never enter my rest.\"\n Even so, his works were finished from the foundation of the world.","4":"For he has somewhere spoken about the seventh day:\\q \"And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.\"","5":"And again in this same passage he said,\\q \"They will never enter my rest.\"","6":"Therefore, because it is still reserved for some to enter his rest, and since many Israelites who heard the good news did not enter it because of disobedience,","7":"God has again set a certain day calling it \"Today.\" After many days, he spoke through David, as it was earlier said,\\q \"Today if you hear his voice,\n\\q do not harden your hearts.\"","8":"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken about another day.","9":"Therefore there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people.","10":"For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his.","11":"Therefore let us be eager to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did.","12":"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and joints from marrow. It is able to know the heart's thoughts and intentions.","13":"Nothing created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account.","14":"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our beliefs.","15":"For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. Instead, we have someone who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin.","16":"Let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."}

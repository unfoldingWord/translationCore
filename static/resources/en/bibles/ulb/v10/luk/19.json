  "21": "for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding person. You take up what you did not put in, and you reap what you did not sow.'",
  "22": "The nobleman said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a demanding person, that I take up what I did not put in, and that I reaped what I did not sow.",
  "23": "Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'",

  "25": "They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.'",

  "31": "If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord has need of it.'\"",

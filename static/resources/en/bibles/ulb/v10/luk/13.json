  "7": "The man said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years I came and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it down. Why let it waste the ground?'",
  "8": "The gardener answered and said, 'Leave it alone this year while I dig around it and put manure on it.",

  "13": "He placed his hands on her, and immediately she was straightened up and she glorified God.",
  "14": "But the synagogue ruler was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. So the ruler answered and said to the crowd, \"There are six days in which it is necessary to work. Come and be healed then, not on the Sabbath day.\"",
  "15": "The Lord answered him and said, \"Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?",
  "16": "So too this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, should her bonds not be untied on the Sabbath day?\"",
  "17": "As he said these things, all those who opposed him were ashamed, but the whole crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things he did.",
  "18": "Then Jesus said, \"What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?",
  "19": "It is like a mustard seed that a man took and threw into his garden, and it grew into a big tree, and the birds of heaven built their nests in its branches.\"",
  "20": "Again he said, \"To what can I compare the kingdom of God?",
  "21": "It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it spread through all the flour.\"",

  "23": "Someone said to him, \"Lord, are only a few people to be saved?\" So he said to them,",
  "24": "\"Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because, I say to you, many will want to enter, but will not be able to enter.",

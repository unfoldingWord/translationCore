  "7": "For Yahweh says this, \"Shout for joy over Jacob! Shout in gladness for the chief people of the nations! Let praise be heard. Say, 'Yahweh has rescued his people, the remnant of Israel.'\n\n\\q",
  "8": "See, I am about to bring them from the northern lands. I will gather them from the farthest parts of the earth.\\q The blind and lame will be among them;\n\\q pregnant women and those who are about to give birth will be with them.\n\\q A great assembly will return here.\n\\q",

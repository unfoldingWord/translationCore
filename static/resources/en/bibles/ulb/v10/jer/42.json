  "3": "Ask Yahweh your God to tell us the way we should go and what we should do.\"",
  "4": "So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, \"I have heard you. Look, I will pray to Yahweh your God as you have requested. Whatever Yahweh answers, I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you.\"",
  "5": "They said to Jeremiah, \"May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do everything that Yahweh your God tells us to do.",

  "17": "So it will happen that all the men who set out to go to Egypt to live there will die by sword, famine, or plague. There will be no survivor of them, no one to escape the disaster that I will bring on them.",

  "3": "Say, 'Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, \"See, I am about to bring disaster on this place, and the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.",
  "4": "I will do this because they have abandoned me and profaned this place. In this place they offer sacrifices to other gods that they did not know. They, their ancestors, and the kings of Judah have also filled this place with innocent blood.",
  "5": "They built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to him—something that I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind.",

People will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no place left for any more dead.",
  "12": "This is what I will do to this place and its inhabitants when I make this city like Topheth—this is Yahweh's declaration—",
  "13": "so the houses of Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah will become like Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops the unclean people worship all the stars of the heavens and pour out drink offerings to other gods.'\"",
  "14": "Then Jeremiah went from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of Yahweh's house and he said to all the people,",
  "15": "\"Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, 'See, I am about to bring to this city and to all of its towns all the disaster that I have proclaimed against it, since they stiffened their neck andrefused to listen to my words.'\""

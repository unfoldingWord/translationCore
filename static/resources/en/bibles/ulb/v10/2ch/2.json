This is forever, for Israel.","5":"The house that I will build will be very large, for our God is greater than all other gods.","6":"But who is able to build God a house, since the entire universe and even heaven itself cannot contain him? Who am I to build him a house, except to burn sacrifices before him?","7":"So send me a man who is skilled at work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue wool, a man who knows how to make all kinds of engraved wood. He will be with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.","8":"Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum trees from Lebanon,for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. See, my servants will be with your servants,","9":"in order to prepare for me timber in abundance, for the house which I am about to build will be great and marvelous.","10":"See, I will give to your servants, the men who will cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.\"\\f + \\ft Some versions have, \\fqa twenty thousand cors of wheat as food \\fqa* . \\f*","11":"Then Hiram, the king of Tyre, answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: \"Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.\"","12":"In addition, Hiram said, \"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, gifted with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Yahweh and a palace for himself.","13":"Now I have sent a skillful man, Huram-Abi, who is gifted with understanding.","14":"He is the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan.

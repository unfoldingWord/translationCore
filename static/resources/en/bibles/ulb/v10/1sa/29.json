  "1": "Now the Philistines gathered together all their army at Aphek; the Israelites camped by the spring that is in Jezreel.",
  "2": "The princes of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands; David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.",
  "3": "Then the princes of the Philistines said, \"What are these Hebrews doing here?\" Achish said to the other princes of the Philistines, \"Is not this David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault with him since he came away to me to this day?\"",
  "4": "But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; they said to him, \"Make that man go away, that he may go back to his place that you have given him; do not let him go with us into battle, so that he does not become an enemy to us in the battle. For how else could this fellow make peace with his master? Would it not be with the heads of our men?",
  "5": "Is this not David of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,\\q 'Saul has slain his thousands,\n\\q and David his ten thousands'?\"",

  "9": "Achish answered and said to David, \"I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless, the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us to the battle.'",
  "10": "So now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your master who have come with you; as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, go away.\"",
  "11": "So David rose up early, he and his men, to leave in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel."

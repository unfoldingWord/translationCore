  "8": "David prayed to Yahweh for direction, saying, \"If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them?\" Yahweh answered him, \"Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will surely recover everything.\"",
  "9": "So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him; they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.",
  "10": "But David kept pursuing, he and four hundred men; for two hundred had stayed behind, who were so weak that they could not go over the brook Besor.",
  "11": "They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David; they gave him bread, and he ate; they gave him water to drink;",

  "15": "David said to him, \"Will you bring me down to this raiding party?\" The Egyptian said, \"Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or betray me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this raiding party.\"",
  "16": "When the Egyptian had brought David down, the raiders were spread out over all the ground, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the booty they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.",
  "17": "David attacked them from the twilight to the evening of the next day. Not a man escaped except for four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.",
  "18": "David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.",
  "19": "Nothing was missing, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither booty, nor anything that the raiders had taken for themselves. David brought back everything.",
  "20": "David took all the flocks and the herds, which the men drove ahead of the other cattle. They said, \"This is David's booty.\"",
  "21": "David came to the two hundred men who had been too weak to follow him, the ones the others had made to stay at the brook Besor. These men went ahead to meet David and the people who were with him. When David came to these people, he greeted them.",
  "22": "Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows among those who had gone with David said, \"Because these men did not go with us, we will not give them any of the booty that we have recovered. Except that each man may take his wife and children, lead them away, and go.\"",
  "23": "Then David said, \"You must not act like this, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the raiders who came against us.",

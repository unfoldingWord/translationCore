  "3": "Beloved, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I had to write to you to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith that was handed down once for all to the believers.",
  "4": "For certain men have slipped in secretly among you. These are men who were marked out for condemnation. They are ungodly men who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality, and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.",
  "5": "Now I wish to remind you—although once you fully knew it—that the Lord saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed those who did not believe.",
  "6": "Also angels who did not keep to their own position of authority, but who left their proper dwelling place—God has kept them in everlasting chains, in utter darkness, for the judgment on the great day.",
  "7": "It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which also indulged themselves in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires. They were displayed as examples of those who suffer the punishment in eternal fire.",
  "8": "Yet in the same way, these dreamers also pollute their bodies. They reject authority, and they say slanderous things against the glorious ones.",
  "9": "But even Michael the archangel, when he was arguing with the devil and disputing with him about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous judgment against him. Instead he said, \"May the Lord rebuke you!\"",

  "11": "Woe to them! For they have walked in the way of Cain and have plunged into Balaam's error for profit. They have perished in Korah's rebellion.",
  "12": "These are the ones who are hidden reefs in your love feasts, when they feast with you shamelessly—shepherds who only feed themselves. They are clouds without rain, carried along by winds. They are autumn trees without fruit—twice dead, torn up by the roots.",
  "13": "They are violent waves in the sea, foaming out their own shame. They are wandering stars, for whom the gloom of thick darkness has been reserved forever.",
  "14": "Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them, saying, \"Look! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones.",

  "16": "These are grumblers, complainers, who follow their evil desires. They are loud boasters, who, for their own advantage, flatter others.",
  "17": "But you, beloved, remember the words that were spoken in the past by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
  "18": "They said to you, \"In the last time there will be mockers who will follow their own ungodly desires.\"",
  "19": "It is these who cause divisions, they are worldly, and they do not have the Spirit.",

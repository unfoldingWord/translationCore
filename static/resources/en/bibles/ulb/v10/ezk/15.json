  "1": "Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,",
  "2": "\"Son of man, how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?",
  "3": "Do people take wood from a vine to make anything? Or do they make a peg from it to hang anything on it?",
  "4": "See! If it is thrown into a fire as fuel, and if the fire has burned both of its ends and also the middle, is it good for anything?",
  "5": "See! When it was complete, it could not make anything; surely then, when the fire has burned, then it still will not make anything useful.",
  "6": "Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Unlike the trees in the forests, I have given the vine as fuel for fires; I will act in the same way toward the inhabitants of Jerusalem.",
  "7": "For I will set my face against them. Though they come out from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; so you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.",
  "8": "Then I will make the land into an abandoned wasteland because they have committed sin—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.\""

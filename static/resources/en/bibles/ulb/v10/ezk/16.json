  "4": "On the day of your birth, your mother did not cut your navel, nor did she purify you in water or rub you down with salt, or wrap cloth around you.",
  "5": "No eye had compassion for you to do any of these things for you, to be compassionate toward you. On the day that you were born, with loathing for your life, you were thrown out into the open field.",
  "6": "But I passed by you, and I saw you writhing in your own blood; so I said to you in your blood, \"Live!\" I said to you in your blood, \"Live!\"\\f + \\ft Some modern versions leave out the second occurrence of \\fqa I said to you in your blood, \"Live!\" \\fqa* . \\f*",
  "7": "I made you grow like a plant in a field. You multiplied and became great, and you became the jewel of jewels. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew thick, though you had been naked and bare.",
  "8": "I passed by you again, and I saw you. See! the time of love came for you, so I spread my robe over you and covered your nakedness. Then I swore to you and brought you into a covenant—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration—and you became mine.",

  "10": "I dressed you in embroidered clothes and placed leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.",

  "15": "But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a prostitute because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by, so that your beauty became his.",
  "16": "Then you took your clothes and with them you made high places for yourself decorated in various colors, and there you acted like a prostitute. This should not have happened. Nor should such a thing exist.",
  "17": "You took the fine jewels of the gold and silver that I gave you, and you made for yourself male figures, and you did with them as a prostitute would do.",
  "18": "You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set my oils and perfumes before them.",

  "26": "You have acted like a prostitute with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and you committed many more acts of prostitution, provoking me to anger.",
  "27": "See! I will strike you with my hand and cut off your food. I will hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene behavior.",

  "33": "People give payment to every prostitute, but you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.",
  "34": "So there is a difference between you and those other women, since no one goes to you to ask you to sleep with them. Instead, you pay them. No one pays you.",

  "38": "For I will punish you for adultery and the shedding of blood, and I will bring on you the bloodshed of my anger and passion.",
  "39": "I will give you into their hands so they will throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your high places and they will strip you of your clothes and take all of your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare.",

  "41": "They will burn your houses and will perform many acts of punishment on you in the sight of many women, for I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.",

  "43": "Because you did not call to mind the days of your youth and have made me shake with anger because of all these things, therefore, behold! I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. Have you not added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?",
  "44": "Behold! Everyone who speaks proverbs concerning you will say, \"As the mother is, so also is her daughter.\"",
  "45": "You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.",
  "46": "Your older sister was Samaria and her daughters were the ones living in the north, while your younger sister was the one living south of you, that is, Sodom and her daughters.",

  "49": "Behold! This was the sin of your sister Sodom that she was arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She did not strengthen the hands of the poor and needy people.",
  "50": "She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions before me, so I took them away just as you have seen.",
  "51": "Neither did Samaria commit even half of your sins; instead, you have done many more disgusting things than they did, and you have shown that your sisters were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do!",
  "52": "Especially you, show your own shame; in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you, because of the sins you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you. Especially you, show your own shame, for in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you.",
  "53": "For I will restore their fortunes—the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters; but your fortunes will be among them.",
  "54": "On account of these things you will show your shame; you will be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and in this way you will be a comfort to them.",
  "55": "So your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.",
  "56": "Sodom your sister was not even mentioned by your mouth in the days when you were proud,",
  "57": "before your wickedness was revealed. But now you are an object of scorn to the daughters of Edom and to all the daughters of the Philistines around her. People all about despise you.\\f + \\ft Instead of \\fqa Edom \\fqa* , some ancient copies and modern versions have \\fqa Aram \\fqa* , that is, Syria. \\f*",

  "60": "But I myself will call to mind my covenant with you made in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.",
  "61": "Then you will call to mind your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters and your younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.",
  "62": "I myself will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.",
  "63": "Because of these things, you will call everything to mind and be ashamed, so you will no longer open your mouth to speak because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'\""

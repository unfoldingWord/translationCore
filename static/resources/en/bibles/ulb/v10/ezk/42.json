There were three levels of rooms, and the ones above looked down on the ones below and were open to them, having a walkway. Some of the rooms looked out onto the outer courtyard.","4":"A passage ten cubits in width and one hundred cubits in length ran in front of the rooms. The rooms' doors were toward the north.\\f + \\ft Some ancient versions and many modern versions read \\fqa one hundred cubits \\fqa* .

A passage on the inside had a door at its head, and the passage opened into the various rooms.

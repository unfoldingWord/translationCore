  "8": "Now then, tell my servant David, \"This is what Yahweh of hosts says: 'I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, so that you would be ruler over my people Israel.",
  "9": "I have been with you wherever you went. I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the \ngreat ones of the earth.",
  "10": "I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,",
  "11": "as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Now I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, I, Yahweh declare to you that I will make you a house.",

  "18": "Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh and said, \"Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?",
  "19": "Now this was a small thing in your sight, Lord Yahweh. You have even spoken about your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Lord Yahweh!",
  "20": "What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant, Lord Yahweh.",
  "21": "For your word's sake, and to fulfill your own purpose, you have done this great thing and revealed it to your servant.",

  "28": "Now, Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are trustworthy, and you have made this good promise to your servant.",
  "29": "Now then, let it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, Lord Yahweh, have said these things, and with your blessing your servant's house will be blessed forever.\""

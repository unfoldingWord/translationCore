{"1":"Suppose that I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. But if I do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.","2":"Suppose that I have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and knowledge, and that I have all faith so as to remove mountains. But if I do not have love, I am nothing.","3":"Suppose that I give all I own to feed the poor, and that I give my body to be burned. But if I do not have love, I gain nothing.\\f + \\ft The ULB and UDB, together with most versions, read, \\fqa I give my body to be burned. \\fqa* Some older versions read, \\fqa I give my body so that I might boast. \\fqa* \\f*","4":"Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant","5":"or rude. It is not self-serving. It is not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.","6":"It does not rejoice in unrighteousness. Instead, it rejoices in the truth.","7":"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.","8":"Love never ends. If there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away.","9":"For we know in part and we prophesy in part.","10":"But when the perfect comes, that which is incomplete will pass away.","11":"When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I put away childish things.","12":"For now we see indirectly in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I have been fully known.","13":"But now these three remain: faith, future confidence, and love. But the greatest of these is love."}

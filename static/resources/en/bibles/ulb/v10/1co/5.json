{"1":"We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that is not even permitted among the Gentiles. The report is that one of you is sleeping with his father's wife.","2":"You are so arrogant! Should you not mourn instead? The one who did this must be removed from among you.","3":"For even though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as though I were there.","4":"When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,","5":"hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.","6":"Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?","7":"Cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may be new dough, so that you may be unleavened bread. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.","8":"So let us then celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness. Instead, let us celebrate with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.","9":"I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.","10":"In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters, since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world.","11":"But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother but who is living in sexual immorality, or who is greedy, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive, or is a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat a meal with such a person.","12":"For how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church? Instead, are you not to judge those who are inside the church?","13":"But God judges those who are on the outside.\\q \"Remove the evil person from among you.\"\n\\m"}

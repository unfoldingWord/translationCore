  "2": "I have spread out my hands all day to a stubborn people,\\q1 who walk in a way that is not good, who have walked after their own thoughts and plans!\n\n\n\\q1",
  "3": "They are a people who continually offend me,\\q1 offering sacrifices in gardens, and burning incense on brick tiles.\n\\q1",
  "4": "They sit among the graves and keep watch all night,\\q1 and eat pork with the broth of foul meat in\ntheir dishes.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "5": "They say, 'Stand away, do not come near to me, for I am holier than you.'\\q1 These things are smoke in my nose, a fire that\nburns all day long.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "6": "Look, it is written before me:\\q1 I will not keep quiet, for I will pay them back; I will repay them into their laps,\n\\q1",
  "7": "for their sins and the sins of their fathers together,\" says Yahweh.\\q1 \"I will repay them for burning incense on the mountains and for mocking me on the hills.\n\\q1 I will therefore measure out their past deeds into their laps.\"\n\n\n\\q1",
  "8": "This is what Yahweh says, \"As when juice is found in a cluster of grapes,\\q1 when one says, 'Do not ruin it, for there is good in it,'\n\\q1 this is what I will do for my servants' sake: I will not ruin them all.\n\n\n\\q1",

  "10": "Sharon will become a pasture for the flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds,\\q1 for my people who seek me.\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "11": "But you who abandon Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain,\\q1 who prepare a table for the god Fortune,\n\\q1 and fill wine glasses of mingled wine for the god called Destiny.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "12": "I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bow down to the slaughter,\\q1 because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen.\n\\q1 But you did what was evil in my sight and and chose to do what displeases me.\"\n\n\n\\q1",
  "13": "This is what the Lord Yahweh says,\\q1 \"Look, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry;\n\\q1 look, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty;\n\\q1 look, my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.\n\\q1",
  "14": "Look, my servants will shout with joy because of gladness of heart,\\q1 but you will cry because of the pain of the heart, and will wail because of the crushing of the spirit.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "15": "You will leave behind your name as a curse for my chosen ones to speak; I, the Lord Yahweh, will kill you;\\q1 I will call my servants by another name.\n\\q1",
  "16": "Whoever pronounces a blessing on the earth will be blessed by me, the God of truth.\\q1 Whoever takes an oath on the earth\nwill swear by me, the God of truth,\n\\q1 because the former troubles will be forgotten, for they will be hidden from my eyes.",

  "23": "They will not labor in vain, nor give birth to dismay.\\q1 For they are the children of those blessed by Yahweh, and their descendants with them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "24": "Before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.\\q1",
  "25": "The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox;\\q1 but dust will be the serpent's food.\n\\q1 They will no longer hurt nor destroy on all my holy mountain,\" says Yahweh."

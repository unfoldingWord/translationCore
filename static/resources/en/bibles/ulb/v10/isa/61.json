  "10": "I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh; in my God I will be very glad.\\q1 For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness,\n\\q1 as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.\n\\q1",
  "11": "For as the earth produces its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow,\\q1 so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up in front of all the nations."

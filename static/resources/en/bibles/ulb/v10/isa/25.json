{"1":"Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name;\\q1 for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in perfect faithfulness.\n\\q1","2":"For you have made the city a heap, a fortified city, a ruin,\\q1 and a fortress of strangers into no city.\n\\q1","3":"Therefore a strong people will glorify you; a city of ruthless nations will fear you.\n\n\\q1","4":"For you have been a place of safety for the one who is poor, \\q1 a shelter for the one who is needy in his distress—\n\\q1 a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat.\n\\q1 When the breath of the ruthless was like a storm against a wall,\n\\q1","5":"and like heat in a dry land,\\q1 you subdued the noise of foreigners,\n\\q1 as the heat is subdued by the shade of a cloud, \n\\q1 so the song of the ruthless ones is answered.\n\n\n\n\\q1","6":"On this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of fat things,\\q1 of choice wines, of tender meats, a feast on the lees.\n\\q1","7":"He will destroy on this mountain the covering over all peoples,\\q1 the web woven over all the nations.\n\\q1","8":"He will swallow up death forever,\\q1 and the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces;\n\\q1 the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it.\n\n\n\\m\n\\q1","9":"It will be said on that day, \"Look, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us.\\q1 This is Yahweh; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.\"\n\\q1","10":"For on this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest;\\q1 and Moab will be trampled down in his place, even as straw is trampled down in a pit filled with manure.\n\n\n\\q1","11":"They will spread their hands in the midst of it, as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim.\\q1 But Yahweh will bring down their pride in spite of the skill of their hands.\n\\q1","12":"Your high fortress walls he will bring down to the ground, to the dust."}

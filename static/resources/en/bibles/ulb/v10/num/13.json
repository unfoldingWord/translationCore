  "18": "Examine the land to see what it is like. Observe the people who live there, whether they are strong or weak, and whether they are few or many.",
  "19": "See what the land is like where they live. Is it good or bad? What cities are there? Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities?",
  "20": "See what the land is like, whether it is good for growing crops or not, and whether there are trees there or not. Be brave and bring back samples of the land's produce.\" Now the time was the season for the first ripe grapes.",

  "31": "But the other men who had gone with him said, \"We are not able to attack the people because they are stronger than we are.\"",
  "32": "So they spread around a discouraging report to the people of Israel about the land that they had examined. They said, \"The land that we looked at is a land that eats up its inhabitants. All the people whom we saw there are people of great height.",

  "4": "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
  "5": "\"Then I will approach you for judgment. I will quickly become a witness against the sorcerers, the adulterers, the false witnesses, and against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, those who oppress the widow and the fatherless, against those who turn away the foreigner, and against those who do not honor me,\" says Yahweh of hosts.",
  "6": "\"For I, Yahweh, have not changed; therefore you, sons of Jacob, have not come to an end.",
  "7": "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances and have not kept them. Return to me, and Iwill return to you,\" says Yahweh of hosts. \"But you say, 'How will we return?'",
  "8": "Would a person rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In tithes and offerings.",

  "12": "\"All the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight,\" says Yahweh of hosts.",
  "13": "\"Your words against me have been strong,\" says Yahweh. \"But you say, 'What have we said among ourselves against you?'",

  "15": "So now we call the arrogant blessed. Evildoers not only prosper, but they even test God and escape.'\"",
  "16": "Then those who feared Yahweh spoke with one another. Yahweh paid attention and listened, and a book of remembrance waswritten before him about those who feared Yahweh and honored his name.",
  "17": "\"They will be mine,\" says Yahweh of hosts, \"my own treasured possession, on the day that I act. I willpity them, as a man pities his own son who serves him.",
  "18": "Then once again you will distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who worships God and one who does not worshiphim."

{"1":"Yahweh said to Moses,","2":"\"Speak to the people of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male child, then she will be unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during the days of her monthly period.","3":"On the eighth day the flesh of a baby boy's foreskin must be circumcised.","4":"Then the mother's purification from her bleeding will continue for thirty-three days. She must not touch any holy thing or come into the tabernacle area until the days of her purification are finished.","5":"But if she gives birth to a female child, then she will be unclean for two weeks, as she is during her period. Then the mother's purification will continue for sixty-six days.","6":"When the days of her purification are finished, for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a one year old lamb as a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or dove as a sin offering, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest.","7":"Then he will offer it before Yahweh and make atonement for her, and she will be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law regarding a woman who gives birth to either a male or a female child.","8":"If she is not able to afford a lamb, then she must take two doves or two young pigeons, one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering, and the priest will make atonement for her; then she will be clean.'\""}

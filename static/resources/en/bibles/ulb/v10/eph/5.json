  "1": "Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children.",
  "2": "And walk in love, as also Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.",
  "3": "But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people.",
  "4": "Let there be no filthiness, no foolish talk, and no crude jokes—all of which are improper. Instead there should be thanksgiving.",
  "5": "For you can be sure of this, that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person—that is, an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.",
  "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the anger of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.",
  "7": "Therefore, do not join in with them.",
  "8": "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light",
  "9": "(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),",

  "11": "Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.",
  "12": "For it is shameful even to mention the things they do in secret.",
  "13": "But when anything is illuminated by the light, it becomes visible.",
  "14": "For anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,\\q \"Awake, you sleeper,\n\\q and arise from the dead ones,\n\\q and Christ will shine on you.\"",

  "20": "always giving thanks for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father,",
  "21": "submitting yourselves to one another in reverence for Christ.",
  "22": "Wives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord.",
  "23": "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church, and Christ himself is its savior.",
  "24": "But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives must submit to their husbands in everything.",
  "25": "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.",
  "26": "Christ gave himself for the church so that he might make her holy, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,",
  "27": "so that he might present her to himself as glorious, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without fault.",
  "28": "In the same way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.",

  "30": "because we are members of his body.",

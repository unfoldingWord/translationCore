  "3": "Jesus replied to him, \"Truly, truly, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"",
  "4": "Nicodemus said to him, \"How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?\"",
  "5": "Jesus replied, \"Truly, truly, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
  "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",

  "13": "No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.",
  "14": "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
  "15": "so that all who believe in him may have eternal life.",
  "16": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him will not die but have eternal life.",

  "18": "He who believes in him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is already condemned because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
  "19": "This is the reason for the judgment: The light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.",
  "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light so that his deeds will not be exposed.",
  "21": "However, he who practices the truth comes to the light so that it may be plainly seen that his deeds have been done in God.\"",

{"1":"\"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter through the gate into the sheep pen, but climbs up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber.","2":"He who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.","3":"The gatekeeper opens for him. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","4":"When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.","5":"They will not follow a stranger but instead they will avoid him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\"","6":"Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what these things were that he was saying to them.","7":"Then Jesus said to them again, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate of the sheep.","8":"Everyone who came before me is a thief and a robber, but the sheep did not listen to them.","9":"I am the gate. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved; he will go in and out and will find pasture.","10":"The thief does not come if he would not steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they will have life and have it abundantly.","11":"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","12":"The hired servant is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes, and the wolf carries them off and scatters them.","13":"He runs away because he is a hired servant and does not care for the sheep.","14":"I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me.","15":"The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.","16":"I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.","17":"This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life so that I may take it again.","18":"No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.\"","19":"A division again occurred among the Jews because of these words.","20":"Many of them said, \"He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?\"","21":"Others said, \"These are not the words of a demon-possessed man. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"","22":"Then it was time for the Festival of the Dedication in Jerusalem.","23":"It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the porch of Solomon.","24":"Then the Jews surrounded him and said to him, \"How long will you hold us doubting? If you are the Christ, tell us openly.\"","25":"Jesus replied to them, \"I told you, but you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me.","26":"Yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep.","27":"My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me.","28":"I give them eternal life; they will never die, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.","29":"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all others, and no one is able to snatch them out of the hand of the Father.","30":"I and the Father are one.\"","31":"Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.","32":"Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?\"","33":"The Jews answered him, \"We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are making yourself God.\"","34":"Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, \"You are gods\"'?","35":"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),","36":"do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?","37":"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.","38":"But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe in the works so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father.\"","39":"They tried to seize him again, but he went away out of their hand.","40":"He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and he stayed there.","41":"Many people came to him and they said, \"John indeed did no signs, but all the things that John has said about this man are true.\"","42":"Many people believed in him there."}

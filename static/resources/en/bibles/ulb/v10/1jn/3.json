For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him.\\f + \\ft Some older versions leave out, \\fqa and this is what we are. \\fqa* \\f*","2":"Beloved, we are now children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is.","3":"Everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure.","4":"Everyone who sins is committing acts of lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.","5":"You know that Christ was revealed in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.","6":"No one who remains in him will keep on sinning. No one who continues to sin has seen him or known him.","7":"Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.","8":"The one who commits sin is from the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed, so that he would destroy the devil's works.","9":"Whoever has been born from God does not continue to sin because God's seed remains in him. He cannot continue to sin because he has been born of God.","10":"In this the children of God and children of the devil are revealed: Whoever does not do what is righteous is not from God, neither is the one who does not love his brother.","11":"For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another.","12":"We should not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother.

  "5": "The people of Israel said, \"Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to Yahweh?\" For they had made an important promise concerning anyone who did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah. They said, \"He would certainly be put to death.\"",
  "6": "The people of Israel had compassion for their brother Benjamin. They said, \"Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.",
  "7": "Who will provide wives for those who are left, since we have made a promise to Yahweh that we will not let any of them marry our daughters?\"",
  "8": "They said, \"Which of the tribes of Israel did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah?\" It was found that no one had come to the assembly from Jabesh Gilead.",
  "9": "For when the people were set out in an orderly manner, behold, none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there.",
  "10": "The assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with instructions to go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.",

  "15": "The people were sorry for what happened to Benjamin, because Yahweh made a division between the tribes of Israel.",

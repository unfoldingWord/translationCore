{"1":"Yahweh said to me, \"Go again, love a woman, loved by her husband, but who is an adulteress. Love her just as I, Yahweh, love the people of Israel, although they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.\"","2":"So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.","3":"I said to her, \"You must live with me many days. You will not be a prostitute or belong to any other man. In the same way, I will be with you.\"","4":"For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols.","5":"Afterward the people of Israel will return and seek Yahweh their God and David their king, and in the last days, they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness."}

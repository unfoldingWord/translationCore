  "31": "So Laban said, \"What will I pay you?\" Jacob said, \"You will not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.",
  "32": "Let me walk through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. These will be my wages.",

  "40": "Jacob separated out these lambs, but made the rest of them face toward the striped animals and all the black sheep in the flock of Laban. Then he separated out his flocks for himself alone and did not put them together with Laban's flocks.",
  "41": "Whenever the stronger sheep in the flock were breeding, then Jacob would lay the sticks in the watering troughs before the eyes of the flock, so that they might conceive among the sticks.",
  "42": "But when the feebler animals in the flock came, he did not put the sticks in front of them. So the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's.",
  "43": "The man became very prosperous. He had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys."

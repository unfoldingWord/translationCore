  "3": "Also of the birds of the sky, bring seven males and seven females, to preserve their offspring upon the surface of all the earth.",

  "11": "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day, all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened.",
  "12": "The rain began and fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights.",
  "13": "On that very same day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark.",
  "14": "They entered along with each wild animal according to its kind, and each sort of livestock according to its kind, and each creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind, and every sort of bird according to its kind, each kind of creature with wings.",
  "15": "Two of all flesh in which was the breath of life came to Noah and entered into the ark.",

  "22": "All living creatures who lived on the land, who breathed the breath of life through their noses, died.",
  "23": "So every living thing that was on the surface of the earth was wiped out, from mankind to the larger animals, to creeping things, and to birds of the sky. They were all destroyed from the earth. Only Noah and those with him in the ark were left.",
  "24": "The waters stayed upon the earth for a hundred and fifty days."

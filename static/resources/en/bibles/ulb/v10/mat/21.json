  "8": "Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road.",
  "9": "Then the crowds that went before Jesus and those that followed him were shouting, \\q \"Hosanna to the son of David!\n\\q Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\n\\q Hosanna in the highest!\"\n\\m",

  "11": "The crowds answered, \"This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.\"",
  "12": "Then Jesus entered the temple. He cast out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and turned over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.",
  "13": "He said to them, \"It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers.\"",

  "16": "They said to him, \"Do you hear what these people are saying?\" Jesus said to them, \"Yes! But have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of little children and nursing infants you have perfected praise'?\"",
  "17": "Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.",
  "18": "Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he was hungry.",
  "19": "Seeing a fig tree along the roadside, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, \"May there be no fruit from you ever again,\" and immediately the fig tree withered.",
  "20": "When the disciples saw it, they marveled and said, \"How did the fig tree immediately wither away?\"",
  "21": "Jesus answered and said to them, \"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to this fig tree, but you will even say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and it will be done.",
  "22": "Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive.\"",
  "23": "When Jesus had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, \"By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you this authority?\"",
  "24": "Jesus answered and said to them, \"I also will ask you one question. If you tell me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.",
  "25": "The baptism of John—from where did it come? From heaven or from men?\" They discussed among themselves, saying, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'",
  "26": "But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, because they all view John as a prophet.\"",
  "27": "Then they answered Jesus and said, \"We do not know.\" He also said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.",
  "28": "But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'",
  "29": "The son answered and said, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went.",

  "31": "Which of the two sons did his father's will?\" They said, \"The first one.\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you do.",
  "32": "For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. But you, even when you saw this, you did not repent afterward and believe him.",
  "33": "Listen to another parable. There was a man, a landowner. He planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a watchtower, and rented it out to vine growers. Then he went into another country.",

  "7": "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.'",
  "8": "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'",
  "9": "When the workers who had been hired at the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.",
  "10": "When the first workers came, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received one denarius each.",
  "11": "When they received their wages, they complained about the landowner.",
  "12": "They said, 'These last workers have spent only one hour in work, but you have made them equal to us, we who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.'",
  "13": "But the owner answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for one denarius?",
  "14": "Take what belongs to you and go your way. I choose to give to these last hired workers just the same as to you.",
  "15": "Do I not have the right to do as I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?'",

  "19": "and will deliver him to the Gentiles for them to mock, to flog, and to crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up.\"",
  "20": "Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down before him and asked for something from him.",
  "21": "Jesus said to her, \"What do you wish?\" She said to him, \"Command that these my two sons may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.\"",
  "22": "But Jesus answered and said, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?\" They said to him, \"We are able.\"",
  "23": "He said to them, \"My cup you will indeed drink. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\"",
  "24": "When the other ten disciples heard this, they were very angry with the two brothers.",
  "25": "But Jesus called them to himself and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles subjugate them, and their important men exercise authority over them.",

  "33": "They said to him, \"Lord, that our eyes may be opened.\"",
  "34": "Then Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him."

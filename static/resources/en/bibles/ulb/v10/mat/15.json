  "5": "But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother \"Whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to God,\"'",
  "6": "that person does not need to honor his father. In this way you have made void the word of God \\f + \\ft The best ancient copies have \\fqa the word of God \\fqa* but some have \\fqa the commandment.\\f* for the sake of your traditions.",
  "7": "You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said,\\q",

  "11": "Nothing that enters into the mouth defiles a person. Instead, what comes out of the mouth, this is what defiles a person.\"",
  "12": "Then the disciples came and said to Jesus, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?\"",
  "13": "Jesus answered and said, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.",
  "14": "Let them alone, they are blind guides. If a blind person guides another blind person, both will fall into a pit.\"",
  "15": "Peter responded and said to Jesus, \"Explain this parable to us.\"",
  "16": "Jesus said, \"Are you also still without understanding?",
  "17": "Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is then passed out into the latrine?",
  "18": "But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are the things that defile a person.",
  "19": "For from the heart proceed evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, and slander.",
  "20": "These are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person.\"",

  "23": "But Jesus answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, \"Send her away, for she is shouting after us.\"",
  "24": "But Jesus answered and said, \"I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"",

  "30": "Large crowds came to him. They brought with them lame, blind, mute, and crippled people, and many others who were sick. They presented them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.",
  "31": "So the crowd marveled when they saw the mute persons speak, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. They praised the God of Israel.",
  "32": "Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me for three days already and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away without eating, or they may faint on the way.\"",
  "33": "The disciples said to him, \"Where can we get enough loaves of bread in such a deserted place to satisfy so large a crowd?\"",
  "34": "Jesus said to them, \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said, \"Seven, and a few small fish.\"",

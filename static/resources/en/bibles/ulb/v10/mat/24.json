  "22": "Unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.",
  "23": "Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There is the Christ!' do not believe it.",
  "24": "For false Christs and false prophets will come and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.",
  "25": "See, I have told you ahead of time.",
  "26": "Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out to the wilderness. Or, 'See, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.",

  "35": "Heaven and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.",
  "36": "But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.",
  "37": "As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.",
  "38": "For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark,",

He blasphemes! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\"","8":"Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit what they were thinking among themselves. He said to them, \"Why are you thinking this in your hearts?","9":"What is easier to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk'?","10":"But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,\" he said to the paralytic,","11":"\"I say to you, get up, take up your mat, and go to your house.\"","12":"He got up and immediately took up the mat, and went out of the house in front of everyone, so that they were all amazed and they gave glory to God, and they said, \"We never saw anything like this.\"","13":"He went out again by the lake, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.","14":"As he passed by, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's tent and he said to him, \"Follow me.\" He got up and followed him.","15":"Jesus was having a meal in Levi's house and many tax collectors and sinful people were dining with him and his disciples, for there were many and they followed him.","16":"When the scribes, who were Pharisees, saw that Jesus was eating with the sinful people and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinful people?\"","17":"When Jesus heard this he said to them, \"People who are strong in body do not need a physician; only people who are sick need one.

I know that you have tested those who say they are apostles, but are not, and that you have found them to be false.","3":"I know you have patient endurance, and you have suffered much because of my name, and that you have not grown weary.","4":"But I have against you the fact that you have left behind your first love.","5":"Remember therefore from where you have fallen. Repent and do the things you did at first. Unless you repent, I will come to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place.","6":"But you have this: You hate what the Nicolaitans have done, which I also hate.","7":"Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.\"'\"","8":"\"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: 'The words of the one who is the first and the last, the one who was dead and who became alive again:","9":"\"I know your sufferings and your poverty, but you are rich.

The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you will be tested, and you will suffer for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.","11":"Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

Yet you hold on tightly to my name. I know that you did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, there where Satan lives.","14":"But I have a few things against you: You have there some who hold tightly to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and be sexually immoral.","15":"In the same way, you even have some who hold tightly to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.","16":"Repent, therefore! If you do not, I will quickly come to you, and I will wage war against them with the sword in my mouth.","17":"Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

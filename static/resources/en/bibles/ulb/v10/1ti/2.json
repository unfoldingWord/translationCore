{"1":"Therefore first of all, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,","2":"for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.","3":"This is good and acceptable before God our savior.","4":"He desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.","5":"For there is one God, and there is one mediator for God and man, the man Christ Jesus.","6":"He gave himself as a ransom for all, as the testimony at the right time.","7":"For this purpose, I myself, was made a herald and an apostle. I am telling the truth. I am not lying. I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.","8":"Therefore, I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands without anger or arguing.","9":"Likewise, I want the women to dress themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and self-control. They should not have braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing.","10":"I want them to dress with what is appropriate for women who profess godliness through good works.","11":"A woman should learn in silence and with all submission.","12":"I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to live in quietness.","13":"For Adam was formed first, then Eve.","14":"Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.","15":"However, she will be saved through bearing children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with soundness of mind."}

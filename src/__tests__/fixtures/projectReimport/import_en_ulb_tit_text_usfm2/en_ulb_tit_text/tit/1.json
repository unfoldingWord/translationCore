{"1":"Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen people and the knowledge of the truth that agrees with godliness,","2":"with the certain hope of everlasting life that God, who does not lie, promised before all the ages of time.","3":"At the right time, he revealed his word by the message that he trusted me to deliver. I was to do this by the command of God our savior.","4":"To Titus, a true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior.","5":"For this purpose I left you in Crete, that you might set in order things not yet complete and ordain elders in every city as I directed you.","6":"An elder must be without blame, the husband of one wife, with faithful children not accused of reckless behavior or undisciplined.","7":"It is necessary for the overseer, as God's household manager, to be blameless. He must not be arrogant, not be easily angered, not addicted to wine, not a brawler, and not a greedy man.","8":"Instead, he should be hospitable and a friend of what is good. He must be sensible, righteous, godly, and self-controlled.","9":"He should hold tightly to the trustworthy message that was taught, so that he may be able to encourage others with good teaching and correct those who oppose him.","10":"For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision.","11":"It is necessary to stop them. They are breaking up whole families by teaching for shameful profit what they should not teach.","12":"One of their own prophets has said, \"Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.\"","13":"This statement is true. Therefore, correct them severely, so that they may be sound in the faith,","14":"not paying any attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of people who turn away from the truth.","15":"To those who are pure, all things are pure. But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and their consciences have been corrupted.","16":"They profess to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for doing any good work."}

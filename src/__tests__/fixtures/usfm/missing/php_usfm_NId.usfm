\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the ones set apart in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 3 I thank my God with every thought of you,
\v 4 Every time I pray for you, it is always a prayer of joy.
\v 5 I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.
\v 6 I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.

\s5
\v 7 It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel.
\v 8 For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the depths of the love of Christ Jesus.

\s5
\v 9 And I am praying that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and complete understanding.
\v 10 I do this so that you may test and choose the things that are excellent in order that you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ.
\v 11 Also, that you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel.
\v 13 This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.
\v 14 And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.

\s5
\v 15 Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and others also out of good will.
\v 16 The ones who proclaim Christ out of love know that I have been assigned to defend the gospel.
\v 17 But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish and insincere motives. They think they are adding to the affliction I suffer in my imprisonment.

\s5
\v 18 So what? Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and I rejoice in that, yes indeed, I will rejoice.
\v 19 For I know that this will lead to my deliverance, because of your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

\s5
\v 20 It is my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed. But with all courage, as always and especially right now, I will bring glory to Christ in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

\s5
\v 22 But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor, then I do not know which to choose. 
\v 23 For I am pulled by both of these choices. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much, much better!
\v 24 Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.

\s5
\v 25 Since I am confident about this, I know that I will remain, yes, and that I will continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.
\v 26 As a result, you should be proud of me in Christ Jesus when I am present with you again.
\v 27 Only conduct your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear about how you stand firmly in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel.

\s5
\v 28 And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God.
\v 29 Because to you it has been granted on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf,
\v 30 since you have to suffer the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.





\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,
\v 2 make my joy full so that you are of the same mind, have the same love, are united in spirit, and have the same purpose.

\s5
\v 3 Do nothing through selfishness or empty pride, but instead in lowliness of mind count others better than yourself.
\v 4 Do not look out for each of your own needs, but also look out for the needs of others.

\s5
\v 5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
\q 
\v 6 who existed in the form of God.
\q2 He did not consider his equality with God 
\q3 as something to hold on to.
\q 
\v 7 But instead he emptied himself. 
\q2 He took the form of a servant. 
\q2 He appeared in the likeness of men. 
\q  He was found in appearance as a man.
\q2 
\v 8 He humbled himself and obeyed to the point of death, 
\q2   even the death of the cross.
\s5
\q 
\v 9 Therefore also God highly exalted him, 
\q2 and gave him the name above every name.
\q 
\v 10 So at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, 
\q2 of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
\q 
\v 11 And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, 
\q2 to the glory of God the Father.

\s5
\p
\v 12 So then, my beloved, even as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\v 13 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.

\s5
\v 14 Do everything without complaining and arguing,
\v 15 so that you may become blameless and honest children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. 
\v 16 Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.

\s5
\v 17 But even if my life is poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with great joy with you all.
\v 18 And in the same manner you also must rejoice with great joy with me.

\s5
\p
\v 19 But I expect in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that his report may also encourage me when I know how you are doing.
\v 20 I have no one like Timothy who will truly care for you.
\v 21 For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ.

\s5
\v 22 But you know Timothy has proven himself, because, as a child serves his father, so he served with me in the spread of the gospel.
\v 23 Therefore I expect to send him as soon as I see how things will go with me.
\v 24 But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon, also.

\s5
\v 25 I think it necessary to send you back Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.
\v 26 Because you heard he was sick, he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all. 
\v 27 For indeed he was so sick he almost died, but God had mercy on him. And not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

\s5
\v 28 Therefore I am eager to send him so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I will not worry so much.
\v 29 Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy and honor him as people like him deserve,
\v 30 because he almost died doing the work of Christ, as he risked his life to serve me and supply my needs, in place of you who could not do it.




\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  For me to write these same things to you is not a problem, and they will keep you safe.
\v 2 Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for the mutilators.
\v 3 For we are the true circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God, glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

\s5
\v 4 Even so, I myself could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more.
\v 5 I was circumcised on the eighth day, born of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in respect to the Law, a Pharisee.

\s5
\v 6 I zealously persecuted the church and was blameless in respect to the righteousness of the law. 
\v 7 But whatever things seemed to count to my credit, I have counted them as worthless because of Christ.

\s5
\v 8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things; I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ.
\v 9 And now I am found in him; I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ.
\v 10 It is a righteousness of knowing him, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings—and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death,
\v 11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead.

\s5
\v 12 I have not yet received these things, so I am not yet complete. But I continue pressing on, in order that I may grasp that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus.
\v 13 Brothers, I do not think that I myself have taken possession of it.  But one thing I do is this: I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead.
\v 14 I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.

\s5
\v 15 Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that. And if you think differently about anything,  God will also reveal that to you.
\v 16 Whatever the case, if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it.

\s5
\p
\v 17 Brothers, join me and imitate me, and watch closely those who are walking by our example.
\v 18  I have often told you, and tell you now with tears, that many are living as enemies of the cross of Christ.
\v 19 Their destiny is destruction because their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame. They are thinking about earthly things.

\s5
\v 20 Because as for us, our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 21 He will transform our lowly bodies into bodies formed like his glorious body, formed by his power to control all things.





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends.
\p
\v 2 I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche, be of the same mind in the Lord.
\v 3 Indeed, I am entreating you too, my true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in spreading the gospel along with Clement  and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.
\v 5 Your gentleness needs to be made known to all people. The Lord is near.
\v 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but instead in everything by prayer in requests tell God what you need and thank him.
\v 7 And the peace of God, which exceeds all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any excellence in them, and if there is any praise in them, think on these things.
\v 9 Do the things that you have learned, received, heard, and have seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.

\s5
\p
\v 10 I rejoice in the Lord greatly because now at last you have renewed your concern for me. Although previously you were thinking of me, there was no opportunity for you to help.
\v 11 I am not referring to my needs, for I have learned to be content in all circumstances.
\v 12 I know how to live in times of need, and I also know how to live in times of abundance. In every way I have learned the secret how both to have plenty and to be hungry, how both to abound and to need.
\v 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

\s5
\v 14 However, you did well to share with me in my difficulties.
\v 15 You Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel mission, when I left from Macedonia, no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.
\v 16 Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
\v 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I do seek the fruit that increases to your account.

\s5
\v 18 I have all things in abundance. I am filled. I have received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you. They are a sweet smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God.
\v 19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\v 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 21 Greet every person belonging to Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
\v 22 All the people of Christ here greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household.
\p
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

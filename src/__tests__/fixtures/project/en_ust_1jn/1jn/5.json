  "1": "All those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah are spiritually children of God. Now, whoever loves anyone who is a father {certainly} loves his child also. {So if we believe in Jesus, then we love God, and therefore we should also love our fellow believers.}",
  "2": "We can be sure that we truly love others who believe that Jesus is the Messiah when we love God and do what he commands us to do.",
  "3": "I am saying this because what loving God really means is that we do what he commands us to do. And it is not difficult to do what he commands us to do.\n\n\\ts\\*",
  "4": "Here is the reason why it is not difficult for us to do what God commands. All of us who have become God’s spiritual children have been able to refuse to do what unbelievers want us to do. There is one reason why we are stronger than everything that is against God. It is because we trust in Jesus.",
  "5": "I will tell you who is stronger than everything that is against God: It is anyone who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n\\ts\\*\n\\p",
  "6": "Jesus the Messiah is the one who came {to earth from God}, experiencing both {the} water {of his baptism} and {the} blood {of his death on the cross}. God showed that he had truly sent Jesus not only {when John baptized Jesus} in water, but also when Jesus’ blood flowed from his body {when he died}. And God’s Spirit declares {truthfully that Jesus the Messiah did these things}, because the Spirit always tells the truth.",
  "7": "So there are three ways by which we know {that Jesus is the Messiah who came from God}.",
  "8": "{Those three ways are:} what God’s Spirit tells us, what happened {when John baptized Jesus} in water, and what happened when {Jesus’} blood flowed {from his body when he died on the cross}. These three things all tell us the same thing{, that Jesus came from God}.\n\n\\ts\\*",
  "9": "We rely on what people tell us when we have to decide about something. But we can certainly rely much more on what God tells us. So let me tell you what God has told us about who his Son is.",
  "10": "{First, however, let me say that} those who trust in the Son of God already know that what God says about him is true. But those who do not believe what God says are calling him a liar, because they have refused to believe what God has testified about his Son.\n\n\\ts\\*",
  "11": "Now this is what God has told us {about who his Son is}: “I gave you eternal life, and my Son is the one who makes this life possible.”",
  "12": "Those who share life with God’s Son {Jesus} have begun to live forever {with God}. Those who do not share life with God’s Son have not begun to live forever.\n\n\\ts\\*\n\\p",
  "13": "Because I want you to know that you will live forever, I have written this letter to you. This is for you who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.",
  "14": "I also want you to know that we can be very confident that God wants to do what we ask of him when we pray for what he desires.",
  "15": "Since we know that God wants to give us whatever we ask of him, {if it is what he desires,} then we also know that God is already giving us what we ask of him.\n\n\\ts\\*\n\\p",
  "16": "For example, suppose someone sees one of his fellow believers sinning in a way that would not separate him from God eternally. Then he should ask {God to restore the one who is sinning}. If he does that, then God will bring that person back into spiritual life with himself. However, I am saying this only about people who are sinning in a way that would not separate them from God eternally. There is sin that causes people to separate from God eternally. I am not saying that you should pray for people who are sinning in that way.",
  "17": "Every wrong thing that people do is a sin {against God}, but there are some sins that will not separate a person from God eternally.\n\n\\ts\\*",
  "18": "We know that everyone who has become God’s spiritual son or daughter does not continually sin. Instead, the Son of God protects that person so that Satan, that evil being, does not harm him.",
  "19": "We know that we belong to God. We also know that Satan, that evil being, is controlling all the people who are unbelievers.\n\n\\ts\\*",
  "20": "We also know that the Son of God has come among us and has made it possible for us to understand {what is true}. He did this so that we can truly know the genuine God. And we are sharing life with the genuine God, {that is,} with his Son, Jesus the Messiah. Jesus is truly God, and he is the one who gives us {this new,} eternal life.\n\\p",

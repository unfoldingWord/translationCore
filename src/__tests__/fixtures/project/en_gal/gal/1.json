{"1":"Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—","2":"and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:","3":"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,","4":"who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,","5":"to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.","6":"I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by the grace of Christ. I am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel.","7":"This is not to say that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ.","8":"But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.","9":"As we have said before, so now I say again, \"If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed.\"","10":"For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.","11":"For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.","12":"I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.","13":"You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.","14":"I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.","15":"But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb, and who called me through his grace,","16":"was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood.","17":"I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.","18":"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas and I stayed with him fifteen days.","19":"But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.","20":"In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying.","21":"Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.","22":"I was still not personally known to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.","23":"They only heard it being said, \"The man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.\"","24":"So they glorified God because of me."}

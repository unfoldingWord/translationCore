    "12": "For at that time you were separated from Christ. You were foreigners to the people of Israel. You were strangers to the covenants of the promise. You had no certain hope about the future. You were without God in the world.",

    "6": "This hidden truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and they share the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.",
